# FontDesigner
Being interested in making fonts, TTF/OTF in particular, I've started to wright alittle some code to work with existing fonts and to create new.
***
At the present state of this project functionality contains:
*reading from otf file font-data
*representing font in desktop application
*manipulating with font/editing font data
*TODO translation new/edited font into otf format
***
I've started to fill repository gradually to sistematize and optimize the code and structure of existing codepieces.
